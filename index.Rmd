# Introduction

This guide is a team effort synthesizing past experiences, best practices, and
key resources. Given how difficult it is to start an integrated step selection
analysis and all the choices that need to be made, we created it to
be an approachable gateway to the world of iSSAs. We hope that putting
everything together will help others. Please get in touch if you have any
questions or comments, and if you have any suggested edits.

This guide integrates functions and outputs from the 
[targets-iSSA workflow](https://github.com/iSSA-guild/targets-issa). 
`targets` manages the relationships between data, variables and intermediate 
outputs, as well as the functions that generate them, and ensures that 
outdated objects are regenerated. It also provides helpers for flexibly
batching steps across individuals, study periods or regions. Starting from the 
workflow, users can swap in their own data, variables, and questions
without having to reinvent the wheel. 



## Acknowledgements

Thank you to iSSA club alumni Katrien Kingdon, Levi Newediuk, Quinn Webber,
Emilie Debedan, Eric Vander Wal for the motivation to solve problems and seek
answers. Extra thank you to Katrien for reviewing this document.

Note: Everyone learns differently and reading a document may not be the most
helpful. Working with a group or discussing issues with a peer is immensely
helpful, even for the most experienced practitioners. Every new analysis is an
opportunity to learn and rethink our current ideas.


Thanks to all developers of R, R packages, and related software that 
make this book and related analyses possible. Specifically developers of
`targets`, `renv`, `bookdown`, `R`, `RStudio`, `amt`, `data.table`, R-lib, and R-spatial.
