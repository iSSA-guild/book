## Packages

![](https://badgen.net/badge/status/WIP/orange)


### `amt`

(Signer et al. 2019)

### `glmmTMB`

There were some issues with the installing the packages for Macs, here are the steps that resolved it.

1. remove old versions of `TMB`, `glmmTMB`, and `broom.mixed`
2. install xcode from app store and do all updates for my OS (takes a while)
3. restart computer
4. install `TMB`
5. restart R and computer because I am superstitious at this point
6. install `glmmTMB` from source (there was a repeated warning as posted in the link but it was ok)
7. install `broom.mixed` 0.2.7 using `remotes::install_github('bbolker/broom.mixed')`
8. restart R

### `tidyverse`

‘tidyverse’ is a meta package made up of the tidyverse packages. ‘amt’ relies
heavily on the tidy packages and use their coding practices frequently. There
are pros and cons to this that are discussed elsewhere. All this is to say that
you may not want to install the entire ‘tidyverse’ package but just the ones
necessary for your analyses. These may include ‘dplyr’, ‘tidyr’, ‘ggplot’,
‘lubridate’, etc.


### `data.table`

Some issues with the compiler for mac users. This is actually an issue for every packaged that needs a compiler. Some helpful sites to for set up:
